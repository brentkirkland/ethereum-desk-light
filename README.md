# ethereum-desk-light

This is my desk light that is connected to the Ethereum blockchain. At the moment it is only connected to the Rinkeby network. You must have the Uport app to interact with the website.

## Rinkeby Contract Address:
`0x9173f62b4cd2dfdc523544282f405776925a59fd`

## NOTE:
This package does not build as eth-lib fails to compile with webpack. Until eth-lib is fixed, please run this locally.

## To run:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## TODO
* Deploy to website
* Connect Metamask
* Import subscribe function
* Deploy to mainnet
